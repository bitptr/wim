Commands to Implement:
- r
- wC
- wL

Selectors are missing:
- Regex selector

Workspaces:
- Moving multiple windows to a workspace should work
- Workspaces of number greater than 9 should work
- runWindow should run on all windows in the workspace

Predicates:
- Strings may have quotes
- Can predicates be combined (and, or)?

Tests:
- Then all commands can be unit tested without Wnck
- Maybe crazy integration tests

Bugs:
- XidWindowsPredicate and ClassGroupPredicate don't respect workspace
  restrictions
- Moving causes the windows to grow in height (by a titlebar amount)

Refactoring:
- Move all Wnck into models.py
- The parser not the selector should handle invalid predicates per selector
  type

Documentation:
- Fancy Web site

GTK:
- pin wim-gtk to all workspaces
