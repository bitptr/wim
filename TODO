Commands to Implement:
- j
- r
- wC
- wL

Selector need to respond to moveTo:
- WindowPredicateSelector

Selectors are missing:
- ApplicationSelector {}
- WorkspaceSelector []
- g

Predicates:
- Strings may have quotes
- Regex

Tests:
- Move all Wnck into models.py
- Then all commands can be unit tested without Wnck
- Maybe crazy integration tests

Bugs:
- Wim should not crash on unhandled exceptions
- Comments don't work unless they are accompanied by a command

Refactoring:
- PEP8
- Rename Model
- Break Model into a state holder and state changer
