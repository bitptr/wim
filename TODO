Commands to Implement:
- r
- wC
- wL

Selectors are missing:
- ApplicationSelector {} (see branch application-selector)

Can predicates be combined (and, or)?

Workspaces:
- Moving multiple windows to a workspace should work
- Workspaces of number greater than 9 should work
- Move workspaces between other workspaces by count e.g. :[]mr
- Move the workspaces to other workspaces by direction e.g. :[1]m3r

Predicates:
- Strings may have quotes

Tests:
- Move all Wnck into models.py
- Then all commands can be unit tested without Wnck
- Maybe crazy integration tests

Refactoring:
- PEP8
- Rename Model
- Break Model into a state holder and state changer

Documentation:
- Fancy Web site
