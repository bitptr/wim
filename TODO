Commands to Implement:
- r
- wC
- wL

Selector need to respond to moveTo:
- WindowPredicateSelector

Selectors are missing:
- ApplicationSelector {} (see branch application-selector)
- g

Workspaces:
- Moving to workspaces that aren't a valid number shouldn't crash
- Moving multipule windows to a workspace should work
- Workspaces of number greater than 9 should work
- Move workspaces between other workspaces by count
- Move the workspaces to other workspaces by direction

Predicates:
- Strings may have quotes
- Regex

Tests:
- Move all Wnck into models.py
- Then all commands can be unit tested without Wnck
- Maybe crazy integration tests
